Enclosed is a somewhat enhanced version of a 16-bit device monitor
code. It does a few things which are probably irrelevant to you 
(e.g. notify completion of monitor spooling via a named pipe).

You must create a \spool\fax direction for the monitor spool file.

You invoke it by typing:

    devmon16 [-v#] [input monitor device] [output notification pipe]

For example:

    devmon16 lpt1

Then send data to the monitor, e.g.:

    copy c:\config.sys lpt1

This example will suppress messages (verbose level 0), monitor device
lpt1, and use the default named pipe for notification (don't care).

The spool file shows up in \spool\fax.
